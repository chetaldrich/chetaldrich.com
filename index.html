  You may find me reading about distributed systems, functional programming, economics, financial systems,
  artificial intelligence, or travels to far away lands in my spare time. Feel free to check out what I'm

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>
  <b>Sesquicentennial</b> - Worked with a six person team on an iOS and Android app that lets you explore Carleton's history
  interactively usings maps and location data to provide quests and historical information. I contributed primarily to the iOS app,
  which you can view <a href="https://github.com/carleton/sesquicentennial-app-ios">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Poker Squares</b> - Created as part of research into artificial intelligence algorithms for Poker Squares,
  <a href="https://github.com/chetaldrich/pokersquares">this project</a> employs a genetic programming method that
  uses combines rule-based methods and decision trees to create evolvable
  groups of heuristics that play the game, using that as a metric for mutation and subsequent evolution.
</p>

<p>
  <b>MLOCR</b> - An <a href="https://github.com/chetaldrich/mlocr">implementation</a> of optical character recognition
  for handwritten digits trained on the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST</a> data set. It is configurable
  to make use of Naive Bayes or a perceptron classifier.
