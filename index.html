<p>Hey, I'm Chet.</p>

<p>Professional data plumber. Dog whisperer. All-around nice guy.</p>

<p>
  I'm currently building data pipelines and content tools at <a href="https://pandora.com">Pandora</a>.
  I also spent some time as an intern at Pandora and <a href="https://www.frogdesign.com/">frog</a>.
</p>

<p>
  You may find me reading about distributed systems, functional programming, economics, financial systems,
  artificial intelligence, or history in my spare time. Feel free to check out what I'm
  reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61719074-chet-aldrich">here</a>.
  I'm also an avid traveler and occasional hiker, and those adventures will show up in the blog from time to time.
