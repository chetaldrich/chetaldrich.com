Hey, I'm Chet.

I'm currently writing software for [Root Insurance](https://www.joinroot.com/).
I also spent some time at [Amazon](https://amazon.com) and [Postmates](https://postmates.com).

You may find me reading books about technology, economics, urbanism, history, and politics in my spare time. I keep a log of what I'm reading [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61719074-chet-aldrich).

If you'd like to see some samples of my work, feel free to check out my <a href="/projects.html">projects</a>.

If you're here looking to hire me, or just have a book recommendation you'd like to share,
feel free to ping me at [chetaldrich@gmail.com](mailto:chetaldrich@gmail.com).
If you're just here to look, you can also check out my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/chetaldrich")
and [GitHub](https://github.com/chetaldrich).
