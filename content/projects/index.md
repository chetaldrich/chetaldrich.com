## Projects

This is a brief (and incomplete) list of apps, tools, and experiments that
I've worked on, in no particular order. All are available on [Github]("https://github.com/chetaldrich") to view.

*chetaldrich.com* - What you're looking at right now! Built with Hugo, a static website generation library 
written in [Go](https://golang.org/). You can take a look at the code for the site 
[here](https://github.com/chetaldrich/chetaldrich.github.io).

*Sesquicentennial* - Worked with a six person team on an iOS and Android app that lets you explore Carleton's
history interactively usings maps and location data to provide quests and historical information. 
I contributed primarily to the iOS app, which you can view [here](https://github.com/carleton/sesquicentennial-app-ios).

*Poker Squares* - Created as part of research into artificial intelligence algorithms for Poker Squares,
[this project](https://github.com/chetaldrich/pokersquares) employs a genetic programming method that
uses combines rule-based methods and decision trees to create evolvable
groups of heuristics that play the game, using that as a metric for mutation and subsequent evolution.

*MLOCR* - An [implementation](https://github.com/chetaldrich/mlocr) of optical character recognition
for handwritten digits trained on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data set. It is
configurable to make use of Naive Bayes or a perceptron classifier.
