<p>Living in the Главное Здание (literally “main building” in Russian) at the Moscow State University campus has been a wonderful experience so far. There’s a certain charm to the dual singles that adjoin with one common room and bathroom, the leaks, and the occasional floor board that is out of place. However, this building does take a bit of getting used to, if for only one reason. Take a look at the following pictures:</p>

<p>What do you think? Same entrance, different time of day, or different entrances?</p>
<p>If you thought that these were the same entrance at different points in the day, you’d be incorrect. Upon closer examination, there’s a minute difference where a small box on the left wall of the main entrance in the first picture is placed on the right wall in the second. Nevertheless, the symmetry of the building is absolutely remarkable.</p>
<p>On one occasion, when I wasn’t paying the greatest attention, I headed out the wrong exit, thinking I was heading the right way through the building before (the inside is symmetrically designed as well), headed to my dormitory door, went through the revolving door, headed up to the guard, was checked and allowed in, and went up the rickety elevators, only to realize once I got up to the 7th floor that it wasn’t “my” 7th floor. I panicked. Why did everything change just ever so subtly? Did I enter some sort of parallel world? Unfortunately, I hadn’t (it would have been quite the discovery for the scientific community). After a short period I understood what I had done, and headed back through the main hallways and exited the opposite side of the building. Symmetry can be beautiful. However, if it weren’t for the different color paint on a set of obscure stairways in the lower wings of the building I would never know the difference.</p>
