<h2>Projects</h2>

This is a brief (and incomplete) list of apps, tools, and experiments that
I've worked on, in no particular order. All are available on <a href="https://github.com/chetaldrich">Github</a>
to view.

<p>
  <b>chetaldrich.com</b> - What you're looking at right now! Built with Hakyll, a static website generation library written
  in <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>. You can take a look at the development version of the site
  <a href="https://github.com/chetaldrich/chetaldrich.github.io/tree/hakyll">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Sesquicentennial</b> - Worked with a six person team on an iOS and Android app that lets you explore Carleton's history
  interactively usings maps and location data to provide quests and historical information. I contributed primarily to the iOS app,
  which you can view <a href="https://github.com/carleton/sesquicentennial-app-ios">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Poker Squares</b> - Created as part of research into artificial intelligence algorithms for Poker Squares,
  <a href="https://github.com/chetaldrich/pokersquares">this project</a> employs a genetic programming method that
  uses combines rule-based methods and decision trees to create evolvable
  groups of heuristics that play the game, using that as a metric for mutation and subsequent evolution.
</p>

<p>
  <b>MLOCR</b> - An <a href="https://github.com/chetaldrich/mlocr">implementation</a> of optical character recognition
  for handwritten digits trained on the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST</a> data set. It is configurable
  to make use of Naive Bayes or a perceptron classifier.
