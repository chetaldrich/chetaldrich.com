          Recently I've spent some time developing my familiarity with HTML and CSS (also SASS) for front-end development and responsive web design.
          This website is one of the products of this work, which also functions well on mobile! Additionally, I have signficant experience with Bootstrap, a front-end
          CSS and JavaScript framework.

          I've also spent some time learning JavaScript in the context of web development, and
          my largest venture using JavaScript so far has been developing SharePlay with a team of two others at a hackathon
          at the Georgia Institute of Technology. This particular project used Twilio and Beats Music to play
          music on your computer by text from your cell phone as well as do concurrent playlist management using Meteor.js.

          Finally, I have experience using jQuery and d3.js for web development, which can be seen on a few of my
          %a{:href => "https://github.com/chetaldrich"} projects
          and also right here!

          I have significant experience in Java stemming from courses I have taken at Carleton, specifically
          Data Structures and Software Design, where Java has been used extensively. One such example is an
          %a{:href => "https://github.com/chetaldrich/Asteroids"} Asteroids
          game using the JavaFX framework. In addition, I've dabbled with genetic programming in Java, which was used to create an intelligent player for
          %a{:href => "http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/games/pokersquares/eaai/intro.pdf"} Poker Squares.
          The project can be viewed
          %a{:href => "https://github.com/chetaldrich/pokersquares"} here.

          Additionally, I have experience using Python, in a variety of applications, from web development to machine learning.

          One such example is
          %a{:href => "https://github.com/chetaldrich/targethelp"} AskTarget
          , built using Twilio and the Flask web framework, which acts as a help center in a
          retail store accessible by phone.

          Another example is where I used machine learning techniques to recognize
          %a{:href => "http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/"} MNIST
          digits, which includes over 60,000 handwritten digits that were used for training in
          %a{:href => "https://github.com/chetaldrich/MLOCR"} this project.

          I have some non-trivial work that has been done in C, which includes an ongoing bug fix for scrollbars in the 32-bit implementation of Windows in Wine, open source virtualization software for Linux. In addition, I've implemented a rudimentary interpreter for Scheme, a functional programming language which is a descendant of Lisp.

          Finally, I have some experience with Ruby, which is mostly self-taught, and manifests itself in small scripts and some of the knowledge used to build this website, which is currently created with Middleman.
